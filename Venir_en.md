## Coming to the Balcons

Lacamp can be reached via Le Vigan (from Toulouse, Paris, etc.) or via Ganges (from Montpellier, Nimes, etc.).
 
 **If you use a GPS, enter "Saint-Bresson", not Lacamp !**
 
 :artificial_satellite: Some GPS's make a forest road pass by absolutely impracticableThe simplest _and_ the quickest is, in **all cases, to make sure that you are passing through "le col des Aires, just above Saint Bresson".**

:cow: Otherwise, apart from the delicious camemberts of Marion, the first shop is 20 min away, so the car is (unfortunately) necessary, and the preliminary provisioning to be considered even if you will find enough to survive one day at the gîte!

:world_map: Don't hesitate to call us on arrival or on the way ...

### Par Le Vigan
1. Follow "Saint Bresson" by the D110 then D291. The junction is after the bridge over the Arre (super U, hi the waterfall on the right), before Lidl and Weldom, at the corner with the tax centre (keep a low profile by turning right). 
2. At the bridge (1 km), follow Saint Bresson on the right.
3. After 7.3 km you are at the Col des Aires.
4. Take the hairpin, the only road that goes up. Lacamp is soon opposite.
5. Just before the Col du Perras, take in the last bend the road going downhill (sign "Lacamp" collector, school pick-up, bollard, etc.).
6. Go down to the very end of the hamlet, after the "centre ville", park on this charming square.

NB: You can also come on the Roquedur side by taking the first bridge on the Vigan side.


### By Ganges
1. At the roundabout at the entrance to Ganges, take the route du Vigan.
2. At the last roundabout (after super U, paddle mill, enigmatic restaurant with a white façade), turn left "Vallée de la Vis / Saint-Laurent le Minier / Lodève / etc.). 
3. You cross the Hérault river but stay focused: at the exit of the bridge, turn right.
4. Drive along the river Vis until you reach the junction of Saint Laurent le minier, bridge (say hi to the waterfall), leave Saint Laurent on the right, keep going up, direction Saint-Bresson (quite a way, say ~15 min).
5. At the Col des Aires, take opposite, the road going up. Leave Saint Bresson just on the right and the one on the left which goes down to Le Vigan. Lacamp is soon opposite.
5. Just before the Col du Perras, take in the last bend the road going down (sign "Lacamp" collector, school pickup, bollard, etc.).
6. Go down to the very end of the hamlet, after the "centre ville", park on this charming square.
