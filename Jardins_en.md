## Les Jardins de Lacamp ##

If you are living the dream and live in both houses, some more information can be found in the [gîte](https://vbonhomme.github.io/Balcons/Manuel_en) manual. In case of any problem, contact us and we will find a solution as soon as possible, either ourselves or with the help of the neighbours!

### :signal_strength: Internet
There are 3 repeated networks on the house with the same password: 

> ``Balcons_Haut``(gîte)  
> ``Balcons Bas`` (lower bedroom, kitchen)  
> ``Balcons_SuperBas`` (Lower living room)  
12345678

In case of wind or thunderstorm, the internet may not work as well, but know that you have the best installation in the hamlet ;-)

### :poop: Dry toilets
Since you are the guardians of the balconies, it is your responsibility to empty the buckets behind the trampoline. Empty on the "freshest" pile ;-) You can rinse the bucket at the hens' tap and water the fruit trees.

### :rooster: Chickens
Take a look at the chickens to make sure that everything is fine when you go to fetch the eggs or offer them your kitchen scraps!

There are enough seeds for your stay and you can give some water too (tap next to the henhouse, trampoline side).

### :zap: Electric fence
The wires are under tension at night only. No need to test, it shakes hard, hard, hard, the boars being a bit stubborn around here.

### Eggplanting: Vegetable Garden
Pick what's ripe, that's what it's made for ! The watering is automatic and you don't have to worry about anything, except for the cultivated parts around the wooden terrace and plancha side. Give ~10 min of water using the tap next to the wooden shelter.

### :honeybee: Hives
There are a few hives in the garden, whose bees are not at all aggressive and which manage very well on their own.

### :shallow_pan_of_food: Gas
The kitchen hob and the plancha use the same gas bottles. If one of them should fail, you can switch them around. We will refund you when we get back.

### :cloud_with_lightning: In case of storm
Please remember to unplug the oven (physical plug and first circuit breaker in the lower chamber) and the outside garland (plug under the wooden deck, street side). They fear power surges! You can also drop the first two circuit breakers from the panel behind the piano in the bedroom.

The general is, like lightning, likely to fall. Reset it (the big box on the left, behind the piano), just in case.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Tools
If you need a tool, for an X or Y reason, help yourself in the cellar!
