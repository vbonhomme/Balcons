## To make the best of your stay

### :telephone: Contacts
If you have any concerns, questions, etc., please do not hesitate to call. You can also send a message if there is no urgent need:

```
Sophia		+33.(0)6.16.04.22.69  
Vincent		+33.(0)6.95.90.55.79
```

In case of any malfunction at the gîte, do not hesitate to tell us about it, this will allow us to solve the problem for the next ones, or even for yourself!

### :satellite: Internet
```

```
You can switch off wifi by pressing the `<On/Off>` button on the access point at the top of the stairs on the right.

### :poop: Dry toilets
When you think about it, what a load of crap is it to poo into drinking water!

It's simple: after the small or big commission, you cover it all up with a ration of sawdust. 

When the bucket is full (~1 week for two): close the bag roughly, put the lid on the bucket, and take the bucket out. Use the other bucket with a bag. I'll bring the bucket back empty and washed. There is enough sawdust for your stay.

### :cherry_blossom: About chemical products
Residual water (sink, shower, washbasin, washing machine) is purified by plants and then recycled in the garden.

**All chemical products are therefore absolutely forbidden.**

Use the cleaning and bath products provided by us or fully biodegradable products.

Thanks to our combined efforts :

* drinking water is saved
* the compost is exceptional
* purifying plants brighten up the garden
* no more septic tanks, no more nasty sludge to be drained, spread, etc.

### :recycle: Waste and recycling
In the centre of the hamlet are the black (household waste) and yellow bins (all packaging, unsoiled containers except glass).

We will empty the glass for you, no problem. Otherwise there are containers :

 * Le Vigan side: at the junction of Roquedur le Haut
 * on the Ganges side, in Saint-Laurent le Minier and on the parking lot of the cascade 
 
Organic waste: if you eat organic, you can quickly become friends with our chickens! Otherwise, black bin.
 
### :hotsprings: Electrical heating
The installed power is sufficient to live with a sweater but is rather thought as a complement to the stove.

From an energy point of view, and therefore ecological, using electricity to make heat is a heresy. Then to be in Lacamp, you might as well live the adventure to the end, right?

### :fire: Wood stove
If the weather is chilly, the stove will be lit when you arrive.
 You will have at your disposal firelighter, kindling and logs. You need these three elements to make a fire. 
 
 Your stove will start up when you open the ashtray hatch. The knobs for the draught control quickly become hot. Beware!
 
 You will have wood inside, if you need it the reserve is in front of the gîte, help yourself. The ashes can be emptied, cold, in the bucket in the same place.

### :droplet: Hot water
The hot water tank is sized for two people in the gîte taking normal showers (express therefore). If the water turns out to be lukewarm, please contact us.

Otherwise the drinking water is excellent, even pure ;-)

### :zap: Electricity
In case of an electrical problem, please contact us first.

The electrical panel is to the right of the French window, behind the frame and Pablo's painting.

In case of a storm, it is likely that the general will also fall. It is usually given back by us as soon as the power comes back. Should we be absent at that time, please contact us.

### :no_smoking: No smoking
Smokers are invited to take a breath of fresh air on a terrace!

### :sunrise_over_mountains: Living on a ridge

The topographical situation at Lacamp, a small plateau on a ridge, offers us a unique panorama and an equally unique weather forecast.

The weather is changeable and unpredictable, especially concerning the wind. Please fold up blinds, umbrellas, windows, etc. even if you find the current weather idyllic!

### :children_crossing: Children at large
The hamlet's brats are on the loose (guarded) but are often on the road. They are careful and you can return the favour when you drive by car.
